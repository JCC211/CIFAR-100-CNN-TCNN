# CIFAR-100-CNN-TCNN
Scratch built CNN and transfer-CNN using DenseNet121 trained on CIFAR100 dataset.

These models are built using PyTorch and are compatibile with CPU/GPU.
The models were trained on a 4090 GPU.

Parts of the code could be optimized to be more efficient but were designed to showcase certain techniques.
